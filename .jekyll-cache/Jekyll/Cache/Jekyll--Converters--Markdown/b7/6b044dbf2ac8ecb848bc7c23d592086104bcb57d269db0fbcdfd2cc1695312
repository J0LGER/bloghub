Threat actors are coming up with new sophisticated attacks and techniques
that are very hard to detect and prevent. Organization are conducting Red
Team engagements to simulate such attacks, in order to implement
countermeasures.</p>

<p>The objective of Venom is to provide Red Team operators with an
integrated framework. Including a Command and Control server which
will be handling all agents compromised in a target network. The operator
is provided with an interactive web interface that presents multiple
features. The features include a listener creator, an implant generator, a web
shell to control agents and a dashboard to manage different types of agents
(Linux - Windows). The communication channel between the server and
agents is designed to be as stealthy as possible.</p>
